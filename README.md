# Metaphorical Cards

This is an Android app with two decks of metaphorical cards.

You can choose a deck, ask any question and the universe will send a card in response. Look at it, think about what it tells you, and then turn the card over and read its meaning.

You don't need internet to use it. Just download and install the [metaphorical-cards.apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UkVydeBA4Dzj2bEI4LmyAXxHWx-sZGXM/view?usp=drive_link) file.
